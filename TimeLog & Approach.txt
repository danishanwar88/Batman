Ya, I was planning to include more but time doesn't permit it like connect-azure,etc. (But to show same aspect JSON convert function is created and used)
Planned to have parameter file generated at run time but time again. To show did that also for storage and SPN name to go into JSON
Planned to secure the VM with FW rules etc.

But This is what it is. Now I am on Leave on Monday and Tuesday have office and this is the deadline ;)
